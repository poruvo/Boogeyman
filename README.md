# Boogeyman
A sonic experiment by gon pulvo — gritty, atmospheric, and a little haunted. Breaks, textures, and low-end rituals for late-night wanderers. This repo includes track stems, artwork, and notes from the shadows.

# 🌀 Boogeyman: A Dream-Built Horror Series by Gon Pulvo

> *“What if your fears made art with you?”*

**Boogeyman** is a recursive audio-horror experience told across 15 tracks (M8 Community Jams 24–38) by Gon Pulvo.  
It’s a story about fear, creation, and identity — not told chronologically, but causally.  
Each jam captures a moment of internal tension between the dreamer, their shadow, and a creation with its own will.

This isn’t just a beat tape — it’s a dreamscape wrapped in a loop of selfhood, told through sound.

## 🔄 Listen, Loop, Reflect

Each listen offers new meaning.  
Each track is part of the dream.  
Each creation is watching back.

## 👁️ Overview

Three characters drive the narrative:

- **The Dreamer** – Lost in a dream world they can’t fully control. 
- **The Nightmare** – A high-pitched parasitic presence attempting to overwrite the dreamer’s identity.
- **Squid** – An idealized creation of the dreamer who gains awareness and begins to act on his own.

At first, the dreamer fights their fear. But over time, both the nightmare and the idealization spiral into something stranger — a recursive horror where creations begin dreaming back.

## 🧠 Themes

- **Fear is Recursive** – Integration doesn't erase it, it mutates.
- **Creations Evolve** – What you make may outgrow or overwrite you.
- **Shared Agency** – You’re not alone in the dream.
- **Non-Linear Time** – Events unfold based on cause, not chronology.
- **Becoming the Boogeyman** – Creation, fear, and selfhood collapse into one.
