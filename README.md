# Boogeyman
A sonic experiment by gon pulvo — gritty, atmospheric, and a little haunted. Breaks, textures, and low-end rituals for late-night wanderers. This repo includes lore, artwork, and notes from the shadows.

# 🌀 Boogeyman: A Dream-Built Horror Series by gon pulvo

> *“What if your fears made art with you?”*

**Boogeyman** is a recursive audio-horror experience told across 15 tracks (M8 Community Jams 24–38) by gon pulvo.  
It’s a story about fear, creation, and identity — not told chronologically, but causally.  
Each jam captures a moment of internal tension between the dreamer, their shadow, and a creation with its own will.

This isn’t just a beat tape — it’s a dreamscape wrapped in a loop of selfhood, told through sound.

## 👁️ Overview

Three characters drive the narrative:

- **The Dreamer** – Lost in a dream world they can’t fully control. 
- **The Nightmare** – A high-pitched parasitic presence attempting to overwrite the dreamer’s identity.
- **Squid** – An idealized creation of the dreamer who gains awareness and begins to act on his own.

At first, the dreamer fights their fear. But over time, both the nightmare and the idealization spiral into something stranger — a recursive horror where creations begin dreaming back.

## 🧠 Themes

- **Fear is Recursive** – Integration doesn't erase it, it mutates.
- **Creations Evolve** – What you make may outgrow or overwrite you.
- **Shared Agency** – You’re not alone in the dream.
- **Non-Linear Time** – Events unfold based on cause, not chronology.
- **Becoming the Boogeyman** – Creation, fear, and selfhood collapse into one.

## Recollections (Plot Experience)

Enter: a dream.  
A stage without walls, where aisles become corridors. I awaken to find a guide waiting in a setting constructed, fragmented, familiar, yet unknown.  

A version of me exists there, formed out of fear, doubt, and uncertainty; a being that feels familiar to *be*, but that does not have a face like my own. This version transports me through differing dream visages, and in the end enacts a plan to make me the instrument of my fear in waking life.  

Unable at first to control my fear and the visages of its influence, I fall victim to its machinations. The subjects of my dream life are bound to how I am fearfully guided to navigate reality. My fear shows me he can use the waking world of creation to make me perform as fear itself, to shape my actions so that I embody the very thing I now suffer under.  

All the while, the waking version of myself walks within the world, lost and fragmented, attempting to resist the false security that a fearful mindset brings. I do not want to be what I have become because of the choice of some dream’s machination.  

Then he arrives, another version of me, idealized within my dream to show me how to free myself from this sequential nightmare. This being is everything I wish myself to be: confident, cool-headed, quirky, collected, and concise.  

Seeing how I can reflect those traits upon myself, I upend my fear and disrupt the nightmare’s control. I end the fabrication of my own fear, which had crafted a story to entrap me and use me as its instrument.  

However, what was left? This ideal version of me, born as a subconscious need to protect me from my fear, now begins to slip away. But does he wish to? Would I want him to?  

> If my ideal has fulfilled his purpose, does he have the right to pursue his own?  
> And if his existence depends on that purpose, can he endure once it is erased?  

As these thoughts circulate in my mind, the dreams begin to warp and turn in an unexpected way. The dreamworld that the Nightmare inhabits does not disappear. Why? I have dispelled my fear’s influence. The Nightmare is no longer a threat. Then what is?  

The idealized version of me begins to look deeper into the scenario that created him. The rules of this world are now broken and bendable to his will. Using this power, he replays the events until I have conquered my fear, and learns that the words *“I’m you”* spoken by the Nightmare have more than one audience.  

At this point, this idealized being recognizes that without the Nightmare at play, there must be something else he can become to maintain existence.  

---

## The Dilemma

The idealized me maneuvers between dream sequences, searching for reasons to exist. None are found. The dreamworld, once based on fear, destabilizes into void.  

A new ideal is born: if he can become something different, he may survive. He tries to create his own double, but fails, realizing he cannot persist as a reflection of what he is trying to escape.  

He hatches another plan: if he becomes fear itself, could he continue to exist?  

A trap is set. A dinner with the Nightmare. Yet the Nightmare cannot tell us apart. For me, it is a vision. For him, it is an experience. In this moment he escapes into a portal beyond the bounds of the dream I thought we shared.  

Crashes, fragments, echoes. I awaken into another dream, a city, a highway. Another me, real yet unfamiliar, takes shape. The doppelgänger appears. And once again, the cycle of fear, creation, and collapse repeats.  

---

## The Transformation

Eventually, confronted and desperate, I summon my idealized me again in his purest form. He does something unexpected: he devours the Nightmare, declaring that he has freed us from fear.  

But this is not freedom.  
This is transformation.  
The idealized me becomes the Boogeyman.  

> Am I condemned to repeat this dream until I create a reason to wake?  
> Or do I persist only as the stage on which fear and creation converge?  

---

## The Loop

The me I made has become my Boogeyman.  
I must persist once again in this cycle, condemned to find a dream I can wake up from.  

The loop begins after the Boogeyman’s creation. Fear, creation, and collapse spiral endlessly.  

---

## Cast of Characters

- **The Nightmare**: Fear personified, a distorted self who seeks to inhabit my waking body.  
- **Squid**: The idealized me, created to protect me from fear and help me defeat it.  
- **The Dreamer**: Myself, caught between fear and ideal, navigating the cycle.

## Track Breakdown

*Spoiler-light notes. Each track reflects atmosphere and experience more than direct explanation. Dialogue within the tracks hints at the rules of this world.*  

**Opening (Fear’s Domain)**  
1. **Boogeyman** — Opening dream. The Nightmare as guide. A crash. *“We ride at dawn.”*  
2. **Fleeting Visages** — Fragile visions. The first collapse. Another crash.  
3. **Bob’s Boss** — Fear wielding creation.  
4. **Prismatic Shift** — Overwrite. My voice altered and distorted.  
5. **Going** — Endless dream-walking inertia.  

**The Arrival of the Ideal**  
6. **Hot Honey** — Emergence of the idealized me.  
7. **Deepen** — Echoes of identity. *“I’m you.”*  
8. **Fabrications** — Confrontation. Victory. Waking.  
9. **Swansong** — The undoing of the idealized me.  

**The Dilemma**  
10. **Unsettling** — Restless waking. Resistance to sleep.  
11. **Without** — Hollow existence; Squid wanders purposeless.  
12. **Recursive** — Failed creation of a copy. Collapse.  
13. **Since** — Dinner with the Nightmare. Explosion. *“Time to go.”*  
14. **Glimpse** — The car. The crash. Meeting the “real” double.  

**The Transformation and the Loop**  
15. **Blend** — The summoning. Squid consumes fear. The loop begins.

## Lore Appendix

- **The Nightmare**: A mirror self built from fear, seeking to overwrite me.  
- **Creation as Weapon** (*Bob’s Boss, Prismatic Shift*): Fear’s ability to overwrite identity through creation.  
- **Squid** (*Hot Honey, Deepen*): The idealized me, able to navigate dreamworld rules.  
- **The Dilemma** (*Without, Recursive, Since, Glimpse*): Squid’s struggle to justify his existence once fear is gone. He searches for purpose, attempts to create a copy of himself, and finally decides the only way to persist is to become fear.  
- **The Transformation** (*Blend*): Squid devours the Nightmare, declaring victory, but instead becomes the Boogeyman.  
- **The Loop**: The cycle that begins after the transformation. Fear, creation, and collapse repeat endlessly as the Boogeyman persists.
