### **About Bob‚Äôs Boss**

*Bob‚Äôs Boss* is a model of what happens when my own psyche is overwritten by fear.
The 'nightmare' uses a creation that instilled fear into me to model the overwrite process during a dream; showing me ‚Äúwhat I could be‚Äù as the Nightmare. (Imagine being the cameraman for watching your body be controlled in your dreams üòâ)This is Track 3 of 15 in the *Boogeyman* project.

The creative context: the M8 Community Jam theme was **‚ÄúNecrodancer‚Äù**, and this track dropped near Halloween. So I shaped it as a drill-styled spooky rap, a haunted memo from my subconscious.

## **Recollections (Plot Experience)**

Where am I?
Am I... making a song? No, this must be a dream.
The pattern on the floor. The curtains. I know this place. I remember this creation.

Is that me in a suit? What's up with that creepy smile?

Am I... rapping? Why is my voice so raspy and gritty? Those eyes... something strange lurks behind that gaze.

My body feels wrong. This man is me, yet I'm watching him perform some ritual.
What is his (my?) goal? His purpose for animating me this way?
The urge to drink black coffee. I don't even like coffee.

"You'll all be mine in the end?"
That laugh... if this is me, I'm terrified.

## Lyrics
(Verse 1)
Shadows on command 
Life in my hand
They move, they drill 
My armys flame, I run this game 
They crush at will

Graves open wide, the body slide
They hunt, They kill
I am king below, let 'em go,
They take the hill 

Bones grinding cold,
Body controlled,
Don't sleep, snatch their whims,
Destiny Sold

Blood stains where you sleep
I revive the deep
Taught Satan in school,
Death it under my rule 

(Chorus)
I raise the dead, 
I break the chains 
No rest for souls 
They feel my reign
The night is mine 
I bend the rules 
The world is cold, 
I make it cruel 

I pull the strings,
Come at the end 
The light wont rise
And none defend

I own the dark 
Control the game 
All life will fall 
Beneath my name 

(Verse 2)
Got souls on the grind
no sight no mind
They clear my lane

I'm stacking the dead,
They eat what's fed
They run through pain

Pulled from the dirt
Don't need to hurt 
I own the chain
Curse every step
Zombie adept
I make it rain - corpses 
Follow close, I do the most
Flip the script
Darkness in my grip 
They rise, drip, no blood is missed 
I command the graves,
Your fam my slaves, 
I make em blitz,
I control it all, the rise the fall
There's no resist 

(Chorus)
(My 'Employee' Laughing)

## Author Reflection Sabotage
When I wrote this song, the community jam theme was 'Necrodancer'. 

At the time, I'd been rewatching Twin Peaks and the idea of possession came into my mind (framing the story of Boogeyman, once I gave the nightmare a method of 'posessing me'.)

At the time, I wanted to portray the effect of the possession, such that my creation was impacted by the nightmare's influence.

So I tried to make a song unlike something I've done, performing in a way that's unlike me - rapping, lol. (I went for an Ice Spice + Badalamenti sort of thing)

## Plot Context

This song is the model of how the nightmare can use fear to override my experience in real time (like it did in the nightmare).

Lorewise, this is HOW the created/ephemeral beings overwrite. They use experiences of fear to gain footing. 

The best technical way I can explain this in the context of the story is that: When my psyche is influenced by irrational scenarios, hypothetical visions, or real life experiences that induce fear - the ephemeral beings use this fear as a link/bridge from a passive element of consciousness to subautonomous & influential consciousness.

### TF Does That Mean (Above)
At this point in the story: when I am afraid l, the nightmare can throw on 'fear goggles' in my waking consciousness to influence how I act. Whether I'm inside a dream or not, the nightmare needs a resource (fuel) - frightening experiences or something for me to be afraid of. 

#### Why?
At this point in time, being possessed by a shadow self was pretty scary after watching Twin PeaksüòÖ

Relevant to reality, I wanted to portray the idea of 'altered experiences' that are left from a dream. Think of the moments when you've awakened from a bad dream, but you can still see the visages in the waking world? What if those moments were persistent? How would they influence your interactions with perceptions of reality?

## What Happens?
The context in the song defines the rules - this is a ritual. However, the context of the lyrics state - 'he can't ask for your soul'. This is quite important to the 'ruleset' of the world in this story. There are boundaries and conditions between each layer of existence (Reality, Creation, Dream (Within the Creation)). 

I'm not going to explain how these are relevant right now, but the context is currently in the jam tracks in dialogue form. However, it may take some deconstructing of the dialogue to figure out without an explanation. (So, please stay tuned! There is much more story to tell!)
