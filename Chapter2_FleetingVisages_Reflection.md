# **Fleeting Visages**

## Recollection (Plot Experience)
My eyes are open but I cannot move. I drift, formless, still, yet existent. Visages of mountains and metropolises crawl into my mind, imagery and soundscapes from where I’ve been. This must be some form of dream, as the landscape bends and changes before me. There’s chatter of people, birds, and cars in the world around me. I am in motion. The wind blows through the trees onto my skin. I feel the sea push into me… Yet these visions of memory lie still, weaving me into an aural familiarity built from fiction.

What is more familiar is the sequence. Yes… the car, the beach, the birds in the forest. I was just present in this dream. I’ve seen these places before - before the nightmare where I lost myself.

Yet this dream does not feel like mine. Something is off in these sounds and images, though they are pieced together from fragments of my own memories.

“Look,” echoes a voice from deep in the background, followed by a crash. An explosion rips through the air. People scurry and scream. Time slows. Fire, footsteps, confusion, chaos.

What does this mean? These visions carry no meaning for me. Whose experience is this? Who is it for?

## Author Reflection

When I first wrote the story for *Boogeyman*, I imagined it as a me-vs-myself conflict. Over time, I started thinking about dream interpretation, fear, and what it would mean if my own fear became my enemy.

This fit the themes from Track 1:

* the repressed self seeking control over the main self (freedom from social or self-imposed limits like confidence, esteem, or laziness)
* recurring dreams carrying hidden messages
* dream disassociation (experiencing the dream as another subject)
* self-reflection dream imagery (dreaming about oneself)

## Meaning 

When I submitted this track to the M8 Community Jam, I meant it literally: the listener *is* the subject of the dream — experiencing my reflection.

I shaped the song with a washed-out, dreamlike tone — fantastical but also glitchy and distorted, like something is off. The brass chords from the end of Track 1 were sampled and looped to explore the idea of stillness and repetition radiating from a single event.

## Story Context

As the story looped back on itself, Squid’s role became clear. When Squid becomes the nightmare, he discovers both the method of escape and the truth of our relationship - that the nightmare and I are intertwined. In blending with that nightmare, Squid is bound to coexist with me.

The nightmare is omnipresent in the dream world, tied to its domain. Because Squid has already entered this same dream in *Glimpse*, *Fleeting Visages* became a kind of premonition for my created self. That’s why the titles *Glimpses* and *Fleeting Visages* mirror each other - similar meanings, different experiences.


## Blind/Meta Motivation 
In hindsight, it feels almost as if fear itself “incepted” Squid into being: a self that seems to rescue me, but in truth fulfills the cycle. In trying to control too much, fear creates the very thing that undoes it - a mirror of my own struggle in *Boogeyman*.

## Post Note - Interpretations

Eeriely, this is still an interpretative possibility. Without shenanigans from 'Squid'... these visions and fear-based dreaming could be a component of the necessary experiences that inspire me to form a concept of my ideal self (Squid). Such that, Squid seeing these visions after becoming the fear understands how to take over creations using the Nightmare's power. 

Is Squid my invention to escape the fear? Or is the fear itself guiding me, saving me only to hold me for what comes after?

Thanks for reading/listening ☺️
