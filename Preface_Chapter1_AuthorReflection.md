# Preface 
When I began writing this story, I wanted to tell a story interwoven with philosophy, dreaming, music, and psychology.

Thematically, it's been following the M8 Community Jam themes, which creatively keeps things refreshing for me and has allowed me to craft out this storyline.

It may seem convoluted and confusing, but it's for good reason ðŸ˜… - the story is meant to emulate the self & what we do to protect our own sense of identity; despite where it lands us in the end.

I wanted to give ego/idealized selfhood a personification, such that as I change and grow, the things I left behind (the 'ideals' I grew out) of would no longer be influential on my 'self'.

There are a few perspectives on can look at this narrative from. Each character has their own motivations when looking at their root causes, and survival is at the root of them. Me, the fear, and my ideal self are wrestling for creative 'control' over the reality presented to them. And... The villain actually gets his way, albeit unexpectedly.

As I enter more explanation, the sequence of events will be made clear ðŸ™ƒ (Part 2 is starting, and currently in progress)

## Chapter 1 - Author Reflection
In this segment, the theme was 'We Ride At Dawn'; I needed something to be conquered, but at the time I didn't think it would be 'me' ðŸ˜….


## Why This?
At the time I'd been having some strange dreams and had a few thoughts of: "What if I had become trapped by my own dream? What would that even mean?"

So, I quickly wove a narrative of a dream me (the nightmare) taking me over, and winning. Claiming to ride at dawn. Given that I've written the story as a causal loop, the dialogue for the characters lined up well (by accident) - the voice changes and explanations actually gave me context as to how/when the nightmare is NOT my idealized self. 

## It Creepily Worked Out, In the Long Run

However, during these events, the Nightmare & Squid are technically one and the same, potentially fighting each other for control. 

Dialectically, Squid has a persona to him. He's very short, almost monotone, lacking personality. The nightmare sounds like a cracked out version of me - with a higher voice. When they blend and switch back and forth, it was a bit creepy for me, having realized that by the time I would realized how the dialogue would need to be important, the creative aspects fit well enough to be a meta-explanation. Such that from the Nightmare's perspective, Squid is fictional intruder creating a story for him to exist in ðŸ™„, using my consciousness in reality. Given how things play out, who is protecting the creator?


## The Flow of the Dream World 
Each track has its own place in unveiling the rules and laws of the dream world and power system in 'Boogeyman', it's told via context and sound design initially, with sound design to follow. The events are non linear - even if you rearrange the loop, there are still events that occur - the ordering makes no difference. The crash, the cues, the locations referenced in dialogue give clues to the nature of this story loop and character motivations. This first track contains the key event and reasoning: "We (Squid/Nightmare) want to exist; WE want to be the dreamer" (instead of me, the creator)

If you have thoughts or insights I'd love to hear them.
