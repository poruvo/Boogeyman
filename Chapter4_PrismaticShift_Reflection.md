# Prismatic Shift 
## Recollections - Plot Experience 

This experience... Everything is a blur. I'm disoriented completely, I'm walking through old memories...

I can't tell when or where I am. The walls move away as I get closer. My eyes feel so heavy, I can barely open them; but yet I strive to move.

There's a scratching sensation the back of my skull. It's like something is trying to fish my consciousness into my chest.

My staggered steps... I'm moving like a puppet with loose strings. Visages of light, color, darkness, then nothingness.

As I stumble in circles through these fragmented memories, small orbs of light are radiating and leaving my body. What is happening to me? 

How have I lost control over my own body in my own dream? 

I cannot move, I feel asleep, but I cannot wake up. My body is moving on its own! What is this phenomenon?

## Author Reflection 

When I wrote this after Bob's Boss, the community theme for the month was 'Color Change'. I wanted to have a canon transformation aspect of my own!

I already saw how Twin Peaks worked, but I wanted my own sort of ritual - where the creation and fear based state can be used as a catalyst to control me in a dream.

In my mind, 'prismatic shift' is the Nightmare's process of actually overwriting. While 'bob's boss' is a model for what the Nightmare needs (creation, like art + fear + inspiration)

The vocals in the song are from tracks I had planned on releasing before life cooked me a little bit 10 years ago. In this song, the Nightmare uses my past lyrics (sampled) as the creation, it's goal/ambition as inspiration (being free/me), and the fear is my actual experience of being overwritten.

I had a lot of fun writing this song. It's one of my favorites.

Themes from this track 
- Fragmented experiences

## Plot Context 

After 'Boogeyman', I began to have very strange dreams of fleeting visions, me being a rapping necromancer, and losing control of my body.

At this point in the story, the Nightmare has learned what he needs to do in order to take me over while I'm asleep. He's using my fears, memories, and dreams as a method to instill (or install) himself as madness in me. The Nightmare is setting up a method to control me in the waking world, outside of the dream.

Initially, it sounded like a fluke. But... I guess he's serious ðŸ™ƒ
